## Digital Art and Animation
#### I began work in this class with a simple SVG work titled The New Luna Phone. It was designed to be a blatant ripoff of the IPhone to cleary demonstrate my distaste for the product.

#### I then moved on to p5.js, where I created a magnificent work of art called Runic Spear that was inspired off of the game League of Legends and it's artstyle, or any other magical runic graphics. This piece is extremely sophisticated, yet simple. Due to my limitations, it didn't come out as I had hoped, but I am satisfied.
