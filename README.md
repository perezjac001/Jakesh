To Understand what I'm about to tell you, you need to do something first. You need to believe in the impossible. Can you do that? Good. You see that Red Blur? That's me. That too. There I am again. My name is Barry Allen. I am the fastest man alive. My story is pretty simple. My whole life I have been running. Usually from bullies. Sometimes I escaped. Sometimes I did not. But after that night, I was running from something much scarier. Something I could never explain. Something impossible.
